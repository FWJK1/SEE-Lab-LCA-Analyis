Methods This paper does not aim to resolve all the issues at stake. But it aims to provide an explicit and transparent description of how to calculate the life cycle cost (in whatever way defined), and the value added across the life cycle.
Results and discussion The expressions obtained can be fed into the formulas for eco-efficiency, so that an explicit and reproducible eco-efficiency indicator can be calculated.
Conclusions The results are useful for developing life cycle sustainability analysis, combining LCA, LCC, and social LCA.},

	abstract = {Purpose Although Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) is a growing field of inquiry and intervention, to date, there has been a dearth of engagement between this field and critical social scientists interested in questions of the societal impacts of goods and services. In response, this paper is written from the perspectives of two human geographers, new to the field of SLCA. Our aim is to offer an ‘outsiders’ perspective of, and commentary on, the growing field of SLCA, which we frame as a form of political intervention that seeks to have real-world impacts on the lives and futures of diverse peoples and places.
Methods To address these questions, we explore SLCA’s underpinning assumptions by critically reviewing the worldviews that inform its methods, including debates in the literature about sustainable development and corporate social responsibility.
Results and discussion SLCA’s normative and practical applications resonate strongly with an ecological modernization framework. This framework forwards social change via incremental and institutional interventions that promotes continued development, and privileges objectivity, impartiality and the search for a totalizing knowledge of the impacts of good and services.
Conclusions Exploring SLCA’s epistemological foundations illuminates, and in turn, can help to address some of the key challenges SLCA currently faces. Drawing attention to SLCA’s inheren raison d’etre encourages more debate about the overall intentions and limits of the field, and represents not a weakness but rather its inherent quality of exploring the},

	abstract = {The increasing global attention on environmental issues has heightened the demand for a quantitative evaluation of environmental impacts, which primarily relies on using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Despite the availability of foreground data from enterprises and the use of existing LCA software to streamline the executing LCA process, LCA practitioners still grapple with the time-consuming task of querying domain knowledge, selecting background data, and entering numerous parameters into the LCA software. To enhance the efficiency and overall performance of LCA-based evaluations, this paper introduces a knowledge graph-based method towards automated LCA. This method aims to recommend background datasets, encompassing flows and processes, and to automate life cycle modeling and LCA calculations. The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvements, with a flow recommendation Precision@10 of 79.52\%, surpassing current search engines by 4.26 times, and a corresponding 2.45 times reduction in response time within the Top 10 results. Furthermore, processes are ranked based on the knowledge graph and geographical inclusion relationships. This aids in extracting system boundaries and functional units, facilitating process recommendations and sup-porting decision-making. After obtaining the life cycle inventory (LCI), an open-source LCA software, OpenLCA, is utilized to extend and refine the automated life cycle modeling and calculations. The proposed method is validated through a case study on an electrical product, and a prototype system is designed to ensure straightforward result interpretation. In conclusion, this method can efficiently select background dataset, automate life cycle modeling and LCA calculation, and improve the readability of LCA results.},

	abstract = {The circular economy (CE) is perceived as a sustainable economic system where the economic growth is decoupled from the resources use, through the reduction and recirculation of natural resources. In the shift towards the CE, quantifying the circularity of products and services (or their contribution to the CE) is crucial in designing policies and business strategies, and prioritizing sustainable solutions based on evidence. New circularity metrics are being developed for that purpose, but they often present contradiction in both form and content, which contributes to confusion and misunderstanding of the CE concept. This review aims to map methodological developments regarding circularity metrics for products and services, in order to: (1) identify the foundations of circularity metrics used so far and their applications, (2) evaluate the validity of current circularity metrics, based on predefined requirements and a CE definition anchored in the sustainability concept, and (3) provide recommendations on how to measure circularity. The literature search provided a wide variety of CE metrics being developed and applied (seven measurement indices, nine assessment indicators and three assessment frameworks). However, none of them are addressing the CE concept in full, potentially leading to undesirable burden shifting from reduced material consumption to increased environmental, economic or social impacts. Additionally, new metrics underrepresent the complexities of multiple cycles and the consequences of material downcycling. Circularity metrics intended to sustainable decision making should be comprehensive enough to avoid burden shifting, and clearly indicate how the benefits of recycling are allocated between the primary and secondary products.},

The results confirm that the structural pattern affects resilience. In particular, they show that CE networks characterized by a scale-free pattern absorb random-placed disruptions better than the others, while CE networks characterized by a small-world pattern are more resilient to target-placed disruptions.},

Network analysis (NA) can offer a broad framework of indicators to tackle this problem. In this article, we present a detailed analysis of a life cycle inventory (LCI) model from an NA perspective. Speciﬁcally, the network is represented as a directed graph and the “emergy” numeraire is used as the weight associated with the arcs of the network. The case study of a technological system for drinking water production is presented. We investigate the topological and structural characteristics of the network representation of this system and compare properties of its weighted and unweighted network, as well as the importance of nodes (i.e., life cycle unit processes). By identifying a number of advantages and limitations linked to the modeling complexity of such emergy-LCI networks, we classify the LCI technosphere network of our case study as a complex network belonging to the scale-free network family. The salient feature of this network family is represented by the presence of “hubs”: nodes that connect with many other nodes. Hub failures may imply relevant changes, decreases, or even breaks in the connectedness with other smaller hubs and nodes of the network. Hence, by identifying node centralities, we can rank and interpret the relevance of each node for its special role in the life cycle network.},

It became clear that the LCST and Sustainability Crowns are mainly used to help weigh the sustainability dimensions.

The LCSD maps a wealth of information but is more difﬁcult to understand without a deeper dive into the topic. The proposed LCSA-Wheel adopts a clear structure and provides information needed to understand the visualization. Although further developments are still necessary for general applicability, there is a justiﬁed assumption, shown with the help of a case study, that the LCSA-Wheel will gain acceptance in science and practice and thus drive the use of the LCSA.},

            Customers are aware of the complexity of supply chains and link this to a high environmental burden. However, if not coupled with quantitative results, this may be overestimated. The present paper proposes a general method used in the specific case of deep environmental evaluation of a swimming goggles distribution. The results are compared to the consumers’ perceptions, collected and analyzed from questionnaires, and the remaining product lifecycle stages, assessed through the life cycle assessment (LCA). The design and prototyping phases take place in Italy, the goods are manufactured in Asia, and further commercialized worldwide. The environmental analysis enabled the identification of the most impacting lifecycle phases. Results highlight that for small products, with a simple use phase like the goggles, the distribution phase retains a small percentage of the overall environmental impact; thus, it is reasonable to simplify the modeling of the supply chain by selecting a limited number of significant scenarios. This work proves how important is to quantify and rationalize the environmental impacts of a complex system. The end of life and transport phases are perceived as high impacting, but the life cycle assessment analysis reveals that the materials and manufacturing phases retain the highest impacts and are the first that should be improved. Consequently, proper dissemination, cooperation, and communication strategies should be carried out by the goggles brand toward suppliers and stakeholders; the company is now studying how to replace virgin materials with recycled content to lower the environmental impact without hampering the product’s performance.},

Here, we introduce `allotaxonometry' along with `rank-turbulence divergence' (RTD), a tunable instrument for comparing any two ranked lists of components. We analytically develop our rank-based divergence in a series of steps, and then establish a rank-based allotaxonograph which pairs a map-like histogram for rank-rank pairs with an ordered list of components according to divergence contribution. We explore the performance of rank-turbulence divergence, which we view as an instrument of `type calculus', for a series of distinct settings including: Language use on Twitter and in books, species abundance, baby name popularity, market capitalization, performance in sports, mortality causes, and job titles. We provide a series of supplementary flipbooks which demonstrate the tunability and storytelling power of rank-based allotaxonometry.},
